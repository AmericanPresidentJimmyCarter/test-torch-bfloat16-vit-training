# Transformer-MNIST
Unofficial Pytorch implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) with detailed steps.

The original architecture from [An Image is Worth 16X16 Words](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf) has been scaled down for classifying MNIST dataset.

The model achieves around 98.5% test Accuracy on MNIST and can be fine-tuned for further performance gains.
